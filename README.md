I'm Slava Abakumov, developer and team lead working with PHP in general and WordPress in particular since 2008. I am involved into development of many plugins, that have a huge user base and great WordPress ecosystem impact: [Contact Forms by WPForms](https://wpforms.com), [WP Mail SMTP](https://wpmailsmtp.com), [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org), [CMB2](https://github.com/cmb2/cmb2), etc.

On my blog, [Ovirium.com](https://ovirium.com), I write about my observations, experience, thoughts, tools, processes â€“ whatever is part of my daily activity.
