I'm Slava Abakumov, a developer and product lead working with PHP in general and WordPress in particular since 2008. I am or was involved in the development of many plugins, that have a huge user base and great WordPress ecosystem impact: [Contact Forms by WPForms](https://wpforms.com), [WP Mail SMTP](https://wpmailsmtp.com), [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org), [CMB2](https://github.com/cmb2/cmb2), etc.

On my blog, [ovirium.com](https://ovirium.com?ref=github), I write about my observations, experiences, thoughts, tools, processes â€“ whatever is part of my daily activity. You can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://ovirium.com/#newsletter) too.
