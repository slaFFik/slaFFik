I'm Slava Abakumov, a developer and product lead working with PHP in general and WordPress in particular since 2008. I am or was involved in the development of many plugins, that have an insane user base and huge WordPress ecosystem impact: WPForms, WP Mail SMTP, BuddyPress, CMB2, PDF Embedder, Google Apps Loginc, etc.

On my blog, [ovirium.com](https://ovirium.com?ref=github), I write about my observations, experiences, thoughts, tools, processes â€“ whatever is part of my daily activity. You can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://ovirium.com/#newsletter) too.
